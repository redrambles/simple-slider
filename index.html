    <p>I GOT A JOB!!!! My interviewer was super impressed by the skills I took the initiative to learn on my own. I was
        able to "talk the talk," so to speak, which was great! I feel confident going into my new role in just 2 weeks!
    </p>

    <p>My life has completely changed! All of my friends and family are so impressed, and it has brought a certain kind
        of confidence in my abilities not only as a "techie" but as a mom, and person in general that I could switch
        careers and understand and
        DO it. </p>

    <p>This quote is also inspirational!!!! Super inspirational! Because everything is awesome!</p>
